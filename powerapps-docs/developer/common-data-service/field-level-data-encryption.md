# <a name="field-level-data-encryption"></a>フィールド レベルのデータ暗号化

<!-- 

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/field-level-data-encryption 

**This has nothing to do with Field level security!**

Is Paul the right owner?

It is mostly related to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/data-encryption
Pls refer to the PowerApps version of that topic

For Dynamics 365 (online), all new and upgraded organizations use data encryption by default. Data encryption can’t be turned off.

Note that the Email Router mentioned in this topic is deprecated. Is this still relevant?
